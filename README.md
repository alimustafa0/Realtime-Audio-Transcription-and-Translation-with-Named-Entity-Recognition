# Project Name

**Real-Time Audio Transcription and Translation with Named Entity Recognition**

## Description

This project is a real-time audio transcription and translation tool enhanced with Named Entity Recognition (NER). It enables users to upload audio or video files and receive instant, accurate transcriptions while also providing translation services and identifying named entities within the transcribed text.

The application utilizes cutting-edge speech-to-text technology for transcription, language translation APIs for multilingual support, and NER models to extract and classify entities like names, organizations, and locations. Whether you're transcribing interviews, lectures, meetings, or any spoken content, this tool simplifies the process and enhances the results.

### Key Features

- Real-time audio transcription from uploaded files.
- Language translation for multiple languages.
- Named Entity Recognition for identifying entities within the text.
- User-friendly web interface with an easy-to-use upload button.
- Configurable options for transcription, translation, and NER settings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version x.x)
- Required Python libraries (list them)
- API keys for the transcription, translation, and NER services (include links to obtain them)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

2. Install the required Python libraries.
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure API keys in config.py.
    TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY = 'your_transcription_api_key'
    TRANSLATION_API_KEY = 'your_translation_api_key'
    NER_API_KEY = 'your_ner_api_key'

### Usage

1. Run the application.
    python app.py

2. Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
3. Click the "Upload" button to select an audio or video file for transcription and analysis.
4. The real-time transcription, translation, and NER results will be displayed on the web interface.
