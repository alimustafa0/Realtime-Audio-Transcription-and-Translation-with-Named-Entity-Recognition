# Project Name

**Real-Time Audio Transcription and Translation with Named Entity Recognition**

## Description

This project is a real-time audio transcription and translation tool enhanced with Named Entity Recognition (NER). It enables users to upload audio or video files and receive instant, accurate transcriptions while also providing translation services and identifying named entities within the transcribed text.

The application utilizes cutting-edge speech-to-text technology for transcription, language translation APIs for multilingual support, and NER models to extract and classify entities like names, organizations, and locations. Whether you're transcribing interviews, lectures, meetings, or any spoken content, this tool simplifies the process and enhances the results.

### Key Features

- Real-time audio transcription from uploaded files.
- Language translation for multiple languages.
- Named Entity Recognition for identifying entities within the text.
- User-friendly web interface with an easy-to-use upload button.
- Configurable options for transcription, translation, and NER settings.
